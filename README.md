# Android-calculator
An Android calculator app with a terrible UI which I've been working on.
Currently has buttons to interface with most of the Java Math package, plus a few for other features.

This is a small calculator application which implements a variety of operations exposed in a very counter intuitive fashion.

To use the application, input your number into the input field along the top of the screen, and then press the button for the operation which you want.
For operations with two numbers (binary operations) such as addition (a+b), the application will store the value entered and the operation and display a "calculate" button in the top bar. Enter your desired value and then press calculate to perform the operation.

Now available on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Ryan.Calculator)!
